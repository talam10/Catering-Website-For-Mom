            <h4>Let us introduce ourselves</h4>

            <p>
              I am Tasnim. I am from Bangladesh -- a very samll and densely populated country in South Asia. I decided to start this page to show how grateful I am to grow up in a culture where food is so amazing. My mom Sabrina is a great cook but one of her specialty is making rice cakes. Growing up, my sister and I would wake up in somewhat 70 degrees weather that we used to think was VERY cold weather and would be also happy because it is the time of all the sweet treats we wold get. My dad would bring tons of molasses and rice flour from the farmer's market. Sometimes we would also make the rice flour by ourselves. But the gist is my mom would whip up some great sweets (what Americans call pancakes and in Korea it is somewhat close to Rice cakes), we call these Pitha. We put, coconut, lots of date juice, milk, sugar and of course not to mention lots of love into these recipes.

             Now that we are here in the US and we noticed even though there are so many different cuisines available, there is indeed a lack of Bengali pancakes aka Pitha

              So, why not bring all the sweetness to all the sweet people around us?

              As we are small business people, we would not be able to offer any dining experience. However, we would try our best to serve you with great food and maybe some traditional mint drinks? Because in our culture, people also don't drink alcohol. But you know what? We are still fun at parties.
